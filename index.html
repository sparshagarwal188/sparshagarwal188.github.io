                <br>
                <p>Syed is considered the brightest in Patia Basti. Born in India to
                    Bangladeshi migrants, his jovial face bears the mark of a struggling
                    but regular rhythm characteristic of his slum. But his mind works in
                    a dimension beyond his surroundings.</p>
                <p>
                    He is enrolled in a government secondary school, among the brightest in
                    the class (my seniors say it was a nightmare convincing his parents to
                    let him attend school but now they encourage learning). He
                    meticulously finishes off his homework before we come for visits on
                    weekends, so he could spend most of the time talking to us.</p>
                <p>
                    I remember a day he expressed his desire to be a pilot. And that was
                    the day I learnt something very important.</p>
                <p>
                    'I want to be a pilot', he said.</p>
                <p>
                    'Really?'</p>
                <p>
                    'Can I be a pilot if I study hard?' was his question.</p>
                <p>
                    'Sure, you can be anything if you study hard enough.'</p>
                <p>
                    'Did you also study hard so you can fly?'</p>
                <p>
                    I looked at him for a long time.</p>
                <p>
                    'I will fly', was all I could say at the time.</p>

                            At times, we suffer more from memory than the past action, we are haunted by the imagination more than reality, in a flash it’s gone, and we carry the heartache of “what if” for a lifetime to our heart. Roy's mesmerizing debut novel delves into the social tensions and political history of Kerala, India, through the experiences of one affluent family, over the course of three generations. At the book's start the bleak end of the main plot is given away in fragments, and Roy spends the rest of the work cycling among a vast array of perspectives, memories, and time periods, vividly detailing how the sundry small things of the family members' lives led up to an irreversible tragedy. The amount of characters and subplots introduced is overwhelming at first, but over the course of the novel, all are fleshed out in arresting prose. Roy's exploration of class conflict, colonialism's legacy, gendered oppression, and caste hierarchy is multifaceted and compels rereading.

                            After working on this book for several months, I finally finished it and loved it. I've learned that I rate a book highly when it forces me to think and broadens my perspective. Rand definitely accomplishes this in Atlas Shrugged and earns five stars. I am amazed at the depth of her philosophy, her intelligence, and her ability to write and communicate her ideas through strong, entertaining fictional characters.</p>
                        <p>
                            What I learnt from this book: that pride is most beautiful thing, and to live on this earth means that one must understand its reality, and learn to use one's mind to make it what one wants it to be. It is about truly loving life and all that it means to 'live' it. It is the reason why I understand myself as a man who belongs on earth....

                            A Passage To India (September '20)

                            "India likes gods. And Englishmen like posing as gods.”</p>
                        <p>
                            Forster’s novel, published in 1924, dealt with imperialism, showing the interactions between British and Indians in the city of Chandrapore. Most of the English behave in the most atrocious manner, full of conceit, bigotry, racism, and indeed ignorance. But the shock comes from the author portraying both sides in his narration, giving voice to the natives too, and thus challenging the very essence of colonialism. Forster also showed the tension between the Muslim and Hindu characters, who often were just ‘bundled’ together in the eyes of the British.</p>
                        <p>
                            Reading this, I could see the inherent incomprehension between the two sides, their wild and ungrounded assumptions in both race and religion, making the explosion only too natural. Other salient feature is the role of women, some behaving even worse than their spouses, others trying to do the right thing, all used as pawns.

                        <p>
                            The Kite Runner is emotional and immersive, a story that is amplified with its spotlight on society and culture within Afghanistan - both past and present. There are major societal and lifestyle differences between Amir and Hassan but it is the character and principles of the two boys that defines this literary classic. Amir is the son of a rich man, he is educated, refined, and most importantly for social standing, part of the Sunni ruling class. Hassan is the son of the household servant and is illiterate, physically robust, but unfortunately for him, part of the Shia lower class. At a young age, the two boys probably saw each other as play friends, rather than the additional baggage or benefits their class positions bestow on them. This is a really superb book on so many levels – the history, location, religion, social culture, character interaction and it’s ultimately dealing with human emotions of friendship and guilt.

                        <p>
                            Larsson takes what seemed at the outset to be a juicy locked-island-mystery plot and turns it first into an insightful family saga and then into a scathing political and social commentary that forces us to think about such a wide variety of themes and aspects that we normally refuse to accept as part of society. It takes an author like Larsson to shake us into reality for us to stop turning the blind eye at these atrocities.
